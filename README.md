## Abstract
Females exhibit a more robust response to both self- and non-self-antigens than males. This difference manifests as a higher prevalence of autoimmune disease but more effective response to infection in females. Increased expression of X-linked immune genes in female T-cells has been suggested as the molecular basis of this enhanced immune response. Here, we isolated thymocyte sub-populations from paediatric thymi of healthy males (46, XY), females (46, XX), and a female with completely skewed X-inactivation in lymphocytes (46, XX, cXCI). Combining RNA sequencing and high-resolution DNA methylation data we present a sex-aware expression profile in normal human T-cell development and reveal the role of X-inactivation (XCI) therein by generating an extensive map of X-chromosome escape in human T-cells. Contrary to expectation, XCI was highly transcriptionally and epigenetically stable throughout human T-cell development and is independent of XIST expression levels. T-cells exhibit a distinct escape and expression pattern with several genes known to escape XCI being expressed from only one X-chromosome and genes in the PAR region showing no male-biased expression contrary to what has been seen in solid tissues. Finally, using thymocytes isolated from a paediatric Turner Syndrome female lacking a second X chromosome (45, X0) we reveal that the inactive X-chromosome does not contribute to T-cell development or TCR repertoire formation in human females. This study represents the first high resolution map of X-inactivation during any normal developmental process in humans and reveals a pattern of sex-biased gene expression unique to T-cells. The observation of minimal sex-biased expression of X-linked immune genes, stability of X-inactivation during T-cell development and that a second X-chromosome is unnecessary for T-cell development motivates a re-assessment of XCI during paediatric T-cell development as the origin of sex differences in T-cell function.
